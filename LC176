use RDBMS;

create table sal
(
  id int,
  salary int
);

insert into sal
values (1, 1000), (2, 2000), (3, 3000);

select * from sal;

-- solution 1
select ifnull((
select distinct salary
from sal
order by salary desc
limit 1 offset 1),
null)
as SecondHighestSalary;

-- solution 2
select max(salary) as SecondHighestSalary
  from sal
  where salary < (select max(salary) from sal);

-- solution 3
SELECT

    SELECT
      `salary`,
      RANK() OVER (
        ORDER BY
          `salary` DESC
