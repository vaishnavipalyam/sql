-- leet code problem 182
-- Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

use rdbms;

-- create person table 

create table per(
  ID int,
  email varchar(250)
);

insert into per values(1, 'a@b.com'),(2,'b@c.com'),(3, 'a@b.com');

select * from per;

-- solution using count

select `email`
  from per
  group by `email`
  having count(`email`)>1;

-- solution using row number

select `email` from
(SELECT `email`,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY `email` ORDER BY `email`) AS `RowNum`
FROM `per`) as `numbered`
where `RowNum`>1;
